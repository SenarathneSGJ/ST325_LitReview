-   A comprehensive summary of previous research on a topic.

-   It should enumerate, describe, summarize, objectively evaluate and clarify this previous research.

## Objective of a literature Review

-   Give a theoretical base for the research and help the author determine the nature of their research.

-   It may be used as background or context for a primary research project.

## Reasons to review the literature:

-   Validate the originality of a research project

-   Evaluate the methods and identify errors to avoid

-   Highlight the strengths, weaknesses and controversies in the field of study

-   Identify the subject experts

## Types of Literature Reviews
